“We rebuild government websites that ends in gov.tw to a new domain at g0v.tw, so by changing the o to 0 (zero), you can enter the shadow government.” ―nobody in g0v

“Ask not why nobody is doing it. You are the nobody.” This talks the motto of g0v: be nobody. As the largest civic tech community in Taiwan, g0v holds hackathons every other month, attracting hundreds of participants to work on civic ideas. It brings together developers, designers, activists, jourlalists and civil servants.

One of the call to actions emerged was to “fork the government”, which means to improve government service by helping making it better, for the service providers to merge it back when ready.
